  'text': "If this is the first time you've come across the Rapid Kanji app - welcome!\n\nAnd if you've spent hundreds or thousands of hours struggling to learn kanji only to find that you forget it shortly after, you're in luck.\n\nWith the Rapid Kanji system, you'll be amazed at how quickly you're able to learn kanji and retain it. Although your brain will be working effectively to learn and retain kanji, it won't seem hard - in fact, most people find they enjoy the process, which we've found makes it even easier for your brain to remember.\n\nThere are a few key things that make the Rapid Kanji system stand out from other approaches you may have used in the past. But it's easiest if you learn these as you go. In fact the first thing that you need to know is that you can trust the system to guide you through learning and revising kanji and vocabulary in the way that is most optimised for you. We'll explain more about how it works under the hood but in keeping with the 'rapid' theme, let's get started and you'll pick it up as you go.\n\nIf you're ready to get going, click 'OK' below and scroll down to the next section.",

  'header': "'Priming' the Algorithm",
  'text': "Rapid Kanji is backed by a powerful algorithm that takes the kanji and vocab that you already know into account when determining what kanji or word you should learn next. This is one of the key reasons why people find the amount of kanji they can learn skyrocket.\n\nOne of the most powerful ways to get our brain to learn or remember something is by linking the new concept to concepts that we already know. This is a fundamental principle of the Rapid Kanji system.\n\nSo periodically, the algorithm will give you a few words and ask if you know them or not. By indicating Yes or No, depending on whether you do or do not know the word, you are refining your very own version of the Rapid Kanji algorithm and will improve your ability to learn more, faster.\n\nLet's try it now. Scroll down and you'll see a few words that the algorithm has presented you with already. For each one, just select 'Yes, I know it' or 'No, I don't know it' and then scroll to the next one.\n\nClick 'Ok' below and scroll down to the next section.",

  'header': "Learning new kanji",
  'text': "Now that you've given the Rapid Kanji algorithm some insight into what you already know, it will use this to determine which kanji you should learn next. Because our brains learn new things best when we link them to things we already know, if you link a new kanji to a kanji or a word that you already know, it will make it so much easier to remember.\n\nOf course, words are not the only things you know that can be useful for your brain to link to. You also know some kanji. Whether it's just a handful of kanji, or you've managed to already learn over a thousand, you can maximize your ability to learn new kanji if you link them to the kanji you already know. This is because most kanji are made up of building blocks - either radicals (a series of strokes that have a meaning) or other kanji.... TO BE CONTINUED",

  'header': "Radicals and Simple Kanji",
  'text': "Some kanji can't really be broken down into smaller components. These are the base-level building blocks of other kanji. Radicals fall into the same category. This makes them nice and easy to learn by just looking at how the kanji looks and getting your brain to link that with the meaning of the kanji or radical.\n\nIn many cases, this is easy to do because most kanji and radicals actually originated as glyphs or pictures of the things they represent. You might already know the kanji/radical for tree, which is '木' and I'm sure you'll agree looks quite a bit like a tree. Without too much effort, you can remember that this kanji means tree.\n\nClick OK and then scroll down to try doing this on the next section.",

  'text': "Most kanji are made up of other kanji or radicals. While it can be tough learning to write or recognize a kanji made up of a combination of 5, 10, or even 12 strokes, it's much easier if you break it down into it's component parts. And ten times easier than that if you already know all of those components.\n\nFor this reason, the Rapid Kanji algorithm will ensure that before you are ever presented with a complex kanji to learn, you will already have learned ALL of the kanji or radicals needed to build it up - i.e. all of its components. This is another powerful aspect of the Rapid Kanji system and another reason why you'll find your kanji learning efforts maximized more than you've ever experienced before!\n\nClick OK and scroll down if you're keen to learn more.",

  'header': "Kanji Stories",
  'text': "The Rapid Kanji system uses mnemonics or 'stories' to help your brain readily link the components of a kanji (radicals, or kanji themselves) together, along with the meaning of the kanji that they form.\n\nThis is a very common and very effective method of memorization.\n\nWhen you get presented with a story it's always extremely important that you take sufficient time to picture the story in your head. You might find it helps to close your eyes. You should try and picture what's going on in as much detail as you can.\n\nFor example, if you are learning a new kanji and one of the building block components of that kanji is the kanji '日' that you just learned above, the story will contain 'sun' in it somewhere. The more detail that you're able to picture about the sun the more easily your brain will recall it.\n\nCan you feel the heat of the sun?\n\nIs it a real sun, or a cartoon one with a face?\n\nIs it the size of the real sun, or is it the size of a person?\n\nIf you can include emotion in the story as you picture it that also helps. Anger, frustration, fear, love, humor - these all give more for your brain to help retain and recall the information. And the more weird and whacky the storyline - the better!\n\nIn the next section you'll get the chance to learn a complex kanji in this way. The kanji is made up of 3 component kanji. But as promised before, the algorithm knows that you already know all 3 of them. That is why you are ready to learn this kanji. The story will contain the meanings of these 3 components, plus the meaning of the new kanji itself. The story is what links all these things together. By vividly picturing the story in your head, you will link these 4 things together in your brain so that when you come to see the kanji again you can look at its 3 component parts, the story will immediately pop into your head, and voila! you'll recall what the 4th element of the story is, which is the meaning. That's how it works.\n\nClick OK and scroll down to try it out.",

This extra step of recall soon after learning, helps ensure it starts to take hold in your long term memory.\n\nYour brain is very efficient and will not bother storing new learnings in a way that they're easy to recall unless it thinks it needs to. By making yourself go through the effort to recall the story you will tell your brain that this is important information because you are using it again.\n\nYou guessed it - you'll now have the opportunity to do this for yourself. Click OK and scroll down (yep, you know the drill) to recall the story that you just learned before. The exact words of the story don't matter but its essential that you recall each of the 4 components (the 3 kanji and the 1 meaning). After you've typed it in, click 'Show Answer' to see what the story was and make sure you got it correct. If you can't recall all of it, go through it again in your head and work on making the parts that you forgot even more vivid by using emotion and picturing it in detail.",

As you know, this helps the algorithm know which kanji you should learn next. The kanji that you learn next will be the kanji that are used to write the vocabulary that you already know.\n\nRemember that the brain remembers new things best when it is able to link them in some ways to things that it already knows. Because you already indicated that you know that the Japanese word for 'today' is pronounced 'きょう', and because you have now learnt how to recognize the kanji for 'sun' and the kanji for 'now', a simple story that links 'sun', 'now', and 'today' together is enough to tell you how to read or pronounce the kanji for 'now' and the kanji for 'sun'.\n\nDoes that make sense?

For example, after learning a new kanji using a story, you will be tested again after a couple of minutes, then again in about 5 minutes, and then again about 10 minutes later. You might then be tested the next day and if you recall it correctly each time you will then be prompted to recall it in a few days' time. This will continue to 10 days, then 1 month, then a few months and so on.\n\nAt any point if you aren't able to recall the new kanji and you have to look at the answer for example, the length of the intervals will shorten again until you become more comfortable with that kanji.\n\nAgain, you don't have to worry about this or remember to revise things - you just have to spend time on this Rapid Kanji app and follow each section that pops up and without fully realizing it, you'll be gaining in kanji proficiency at a truly rapid pace.",
